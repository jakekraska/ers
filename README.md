# The Impact of Personality and Culture on Extreme Responding

This repository holds the code for the analysis used in the manuscript "The Impact of Personality and Culture on Extreme Responding" by Mrs Anna Klar, Dr Shane Christopher Costello, Dr Andrea Sadusky, and Dr Jake Kraska, from the Faculty of Education, Monash University, Australia.

The "data_cleaned.csv" file is a cleaned subset of data from the myPersonality Project (see manuscript for further details). This CSV file can be found at https://doi.org/10.26180/19212900 as the file size exceeded GitHub file size.

## Abstract

Previous research has not analysed how extreme response style (ERS) is influenced by personality and cultural dimensions in tandem. This study investigated the contribution of personality traits and cultural dimensions to ERS, while controlling for the effects of age and gender. Participant data regarding gender, age, country, and 100 IPIP NEO-PI-R items was extracted from the myPersonality Project (n = 174,059) and analysed using multilevel modelling (MLM) to determine which variables best predicted ERS. Five models (fixed effects were age, gender, Holfstede’s cultural  dimensions, and/or FFM personality domains) were compared. Although all models were significant, personality factors were found to predict ERS more strongly than (1) age and gender and (2) cultural dimensions. Considerations for clinicians and researchers are discussed.

## Installation and Running

* Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/jakekraska/ers
* Open R code in your preferred IDE
* Set the working directory to the source file within the IDE or using `setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext($path)`
* Install the necessary packages using the `install.packages("PACKAGENAME")` command
* The code is minimally commented but basic understanding of psychometrics and multilevel modeling should allow understanding of the output. Some minor R knowledge is required to understand the code.
